# Hotel Guest Satisfaction Analysis - A Business Case Study

This project explores the guest experience using a simulated dataset that mirrors a real-world scenario where a hotel chain experienced a drop in customer satisfaction observed through post-stay guest surveys and investigates guest satisfaction for improvement. Using R and R Markdown, I conducted data cleaning, data preperation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and created visualizations to uncover key drivers of guest dissatisfaction and recommend improvements to enhance service quality and the overall customer experience.

## Tools used
- R, R Markdown
